Contact Tracing - United States - Rhode Island

**CRUSH COVID RI** - multipurpose app that includes centralized contact tracing. It relies on GPS+WiFi location tracking. Locations are tracked by the app only if the user spends at least 10 minutes at the location. 

Users can share their location data diary by uploading it to the backend. Data sharing is allowed to all users - not only to those users, who have been tested positive - and it can be performed multiple times (every time there is an explicit opt-in request).
